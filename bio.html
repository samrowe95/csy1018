        <p class="bio-main">I’ve always loved to tinker with things,
          taking things apart to find out what was causing the problem
          and then putting them back together again.
          I’m curious by nature and enjoy solving problems. <br>
          <br>
          I am a Computer Games Development student,
          in my first year, at the University of Northampton.
          Prior to starting university I was a Technical Support Engineer at Aylesbury College.
          In that position, I assisted staff and students with IT issues, provided support for in-house software, installed hardware and software, and managed various devices for students, such as iPads.
          After two years of working there and developing my interpersonal, communication and technical skills, I decided that I wanted to pursue a career in the gaming industry. I thought that the best
          way to do this was to get a degree in a Computer Games Development course, so I applied to the University of Northampton and was luckily accepted. <br>
          <br>My goal is to develop the skills necessary to become a Computer Game Developer.
